# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The `saigen` CLI tool is an AI-powered saidata generation utility that creates comprehensive software metadata files by combining repository data, LLM knowledge, and schema validation. The tool automates the creation of saidata files that can be consumed by the `sai` tool, ensuring consistency and accuracy across software definitions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to generate saidata files for software packages automatically, so that I can quickly create comprehensive software definitions without manual research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `saigen generate <software-name>` THEN the system SHALL create a valid saidata YAML file
2. WHEN generating saidata THEN the system SHALL query LLMs for software metadata and structure
3. WHEN LLM data is available THEN the system SHALL combine it with repository data for accuracy
4. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL validate the output against the saidata schema
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL attempt to fix common issues automatically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the tool to download and cache repository data from multiple package managers, so that generated saidata reflects actual package availability and naming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool starts THEN it SHALL support downloading data from apt, dnf, brew, winget, and other major repositories
2. WHEN repository data is downloaded THEN it SHALL be cached locally with configurable expiration
3. WHEN generating saidata THEN it SHALL use cached repository data to verify package names and versions
4. WHEN I run `saigen update-cache` THEN it SHALL refresh repository data from all configured sources
5. WHEN repository data is unavailable THEN it SHALL continue generation with LLM data only##
# Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use both local and cloud-based LLMs for generation, so that I can choose between privacy, cost, and capability based on my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure an OpenAI API key THEN the system SHALL support GPT models for generation
2. WHEN I configure Anthropic credentials THEN the system SHALL support Claude models
3. WHEN I run local models THEN the system SHALL support Ollama and other local LLM servers
4. WHEN multiple LLM providers are configured THEN I SHALL be able to specify which to use
5. WHEN LLM requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options or graceful degradation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality engineer, I want comprehensive validation and testing of generated saidata, so that I can ensure the metadata is accurate and functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN saidata is generated THEN it SHALL be validated against the JSON schema automatically
2. WHEN I run `saigen validate <file>` THEN it SHALL perform deep validation including cross-references
3. WHEN I run `saigen test <file>` THEN it SHALL test the saidata using available providers
4. WHEN testing is enabled THEN it SHALL support dry-run testing without actual installation
5. WHEN MCP servers are available THEN it SHALL use them for extended testing capabilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities, so that the tool can use repository metadata to improve LLM-generated content accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating saidata THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant repository data for context
2. WHEN repository data exists THEN it SHALL be embedded and used for semantic search
3. WHEN LLM queries are made THEN relevant repository context SHALL be included in prompts
4. WHEN I run `saigen index` THEN it SHALL rebuild the RAG index from cached repository data
5. WHEN similar software exists THEN it SHALL use existing saidata as examples in generation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a batch processing user, I want to generate saidata for multiple software packages efficiently, so that I can create comprehensive software catalogs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `saigen batch <software-list>` THEN it SHALL process multiple software packages
2. WHEN batch processing THEN it SHALL support parallel generation with configurable concurrency
3. WHEN batch processing THEN it SHALL continue on individual failures and report summary
4. WHEN I provide a category filter THEN it SHALL generate saidata only for matching software
5. WHEN batch processing completes THEN it SHALL provide detailed success/failure statistics### Requ
irement 7

**User Story:** As a configuration manager, I want flexible configuration options for LLM providers, repository sources, and generation parameters, so that I can customize the tool for different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from standard config file locations
2. WHEN I configure LLM settings THEN it SHALL support API keys, endpoints, and model parameters
3. WHEN I configure repository sources THEN it SHALL support custom repository URLs and credentials
4. WHEN I run `saigen config` THEN it SHALL display current configuration with sensitive data masked
5. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN it SHALL provide helpful error messages and use defaults

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a software maintainer, I want to update existing saidata files with new information, so that I can keep software definitions current without starting from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `saigen update <existing-file>` THEN it SHALL enhance existing saidata with new information
2. WHEN updating THEN it SHALL preserve manual customizations and user-added fields
3. WHEN conflicts exist THEN it SHALL prompt for resolution or use configurable merge strategies
4. WHEN I use `--force-update` THEN it SHALL regenerate the file completely
5. WHEN updating THEN it SHALL create backup copies of original files
