# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The `sai` CLI tool is a cross-platform software management utility that detects locally available package managers and providers, then executes software management actions based on saidata definitions. The tool acts as a universal interface that abstracts provider-specific commands while maintaining native platform behavior and conventions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to install software using a unified command interface, so that I can manage packages consistently across different platforms and providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `sai install <software>` THEN the system SHALL detect available providers on the current platform
2. WHEN multiple providers are available THEN the system SHALL suggest the most appropriate provider based on priority rules, list all the available ones with the command expeced to be executed and ask for user confirmation or selection (enter for default, or number from available list)
3. WHEN I specify `--provider <name>` THEN the system SHALL use only the specified provider
4. IF the specified provider is not available THEN the system SHALL display an error message and exit
5. WHEN installation succeeds THEN the system SHALL display success confirmation with provider used and command executed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool to automatically detect which providers (package manager or any tool than can perform a sai action) are installed on my system, so that I don't need to manually configure provider availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool starts THEN it SHALL scan the system for available provider executables
2. WHEN a provider executable is found THEN it SHALL verify the provider is functional with a test command (defined in providerdata)
3. WHEN provider detection completes THEN it SHALL cache the results for subsequent runs
4. IF no providers are detected THEN the system SHALL display helpful guidance for installing package managers or other tools
5. WHEN I run `sai providers` THEN it SHALL list all detected providers with their status and the actions they can perform

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to execute various software management actions beyond installation, so that I can fully manage software lifecycle through the unified interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `sai <action> <software>` THEN the system SHALL support actions: install, uninstall, start, stop, restart, status, info...
2. WHEN an action is not supported by the current provider THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
3. WHEN I run `sai list` THEN it SHALL show installed software managed through sai
4. WHEN I run `sai search <term>` THEN it SHALL search for available software using the default provider
5. WHEN service actions are used THEN it SHALL manage services according to the platform's service system
6. WHEN an action involves changes on the system (install, start, stop, uninstall...) always ask for user configuration by default (allow unattended runs via user config or --yes -y options)
7. WHEN an action just shows information without changes (info, log, debug ... ) then just run it for all the available providers supporting it (with --provider option run the action only for the given providers)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the tool to load saidata from multiple sources, so that I can use both bundled definitions and custom software configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool needs saidata THEN it SHALL search in order: current directory, user config directory, system directory, official saidata git repo
2. WHEN saidata files are found THEN it SHALL validate them against the schema before use
3. WHEN multiple saidata files exist for the same software THEN it SHALL merge them with user configs taking precedence
4. IF saidata validation fails THEN the system SHALL display detailed error information
5. WHEN I run `sai validate <file>` THEN it SHALL validate saidata files and report any issues

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive logging and error handling, so that I can troubleshoot issues and integrate the tool into automation workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation executes THEN it SHALL log actions to a configurable log file
2. WHEN errors occur THEN it SHALL provide detailed error messages with context
3. WHEN I use `--verbose` flag THEN it SHALL display detailed execution information
4. WHEN I use `--dry-run` flag THEN it SHALL show what would be executed without making changes
5. WHEN operations fail THEN it SHALL exit with appropriate error codes for automation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want flexible configuration options, so that I can customize the tool's behavior for my environment and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from standard config file locations
2. WHEN I set provider priorities THEN it SHALL respect those priorities during provider selection
3. WHEN I configure custom saidata directories THEN it SHALL search those locations
4. WHEN I run `sai config` THEN it SHALL display current configuration settings
5. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN it SHALL display helpful error messages and use defaults
