# Fix: Context Enhancement Error for 0.3 Schema

## Issue
When generating saidata with the 0.3 schema, users encountered the error:
```
Failed to enhance context for 0.3 schema: 'NoneType' object does not support item assignment
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred in `saigen/utils/generation_logger.py` in the `log_generation_context_enhancement` method. The method was checking if the key `"generation_context"` existed in `self.log_data`, but not checking if its value was `None`.

In the `GenerationLogger.__init__` method, `log_data` is initialized with:
```python
"generation_context": None,
```

When `log_generation_context_enhancement` was called, it checked:
```python
if "generation_context" not in self.log_data:
    self.log_data["generation_context"] = {}
```

Since the key existed (but with value `None`), the condition was False, and the code proceeded to:
```python
self.log_data["generation_context"]["enhancement_v03"] = enhancement_info
```

This failed because `self.log_data["generation_context"]` was `None`, not a dictionary.

## Solution
Modified the check in `log_generation_context_enhancement` to also verify the value is not `None`:

```python
if "generation_context" not in self.log_data or self.log_data["generation_context"] is None:
    self.log_data["generation_context"] = {}
```

## Additional Improvements
While debugging, also added defensive checks in `saigen/core/context_builder.py`:
- Added null-safety check for `target_providers` in `_add_compatibility_matrix_context`
- Updated type hint for `_determine_compatibility_scope` to accept `Optional[List[str]]`
- Added null-safe filtering when checking provider entries

## Files Modified
1. `saigen/utils/generation_logger.py` - Fixed the None check in `log_generation_context_enhancement`
2. `saigen/core/context_builder.py` - Added defensive null checks for target_providers

## Testing
Verified the fix by running:
```bash
saigen generate prometheus --force
saigen generate redis --force
saigen generate nginx --force
```

All commands completed successfully without the "Failed to enhance context" error.
