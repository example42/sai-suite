# Consolidation Verification Checklist

## Date: October 4, 2025

### ✅ File Operations
- [x] Renamed `context_builder_v03.py` to `context_builder.py`
- [x] Deleted `prompts_v03.py`
- [x] Moved `ContextBuilderV03` class into `context_builder.py`
- [x] Updated class name `EnhancedContextBuilderV03` → `EnhancedContextBuilder`

### ✅ Import Updates
- [x] Updated `generation_engine.py` imports
- [x] Verified no remaining references to old files
- [x] Verified no remaining references to old class names

### ✅ Code Quality
- [x] No diagnostic errors in modified files
- [x] All imports resolve correctly
- [x] Code follows existing patterns

### ✅ Functionality Tests
- [x] Basic import test passed
- [x] Generation engine import test passed
- [x] CLI help command works
- [x] Generation test: redis ✓
- [x] Generation test: terraform ✓
- [x] No checksums in generated files ✓

### ✅ Generated Files Quality
- [x] Redis: Valid YAML, no checksums, proper structure
- [x] Terraform: Valid YAML, no checksums, proper structure
- [x] Sources section: No checksum field
- [x] Binaries section: No checksum field
- [x] Scripts section: No checksum field (when present)

### ✅ Documentation
- [x] Created consolidation summary
- [x] Created architecture documentation
- [x] Created migration guide
- [x] Updated with testing results

## Summary

**All checks passed!** ✅

The consolidation is complete and fully functional. The codebase is now:
- Simpler (fewer files)
- Clearer (no duplicate implementations)
- Maintainable (single source of truth)
- Fully tested (multiple generation tests successful)

## Test Commands Used

```bash
# Import tests
python -c "from saigen.core.context_builder import EnhancedContextBuilder; print('✓')"
python -c "from saigen.core.generation_engine import GenerationEngine; print('✓')"

# CLI test
python -m saigen --help

# Generation tests
python -m saigen generate redis --force
python -m saigen generate terraform --force

# Checksum verification
grep -i checksum /path/to/generated/files
```

## Files Generated During Testing

1. `/Users/al/Documents/GITHUB/saidata/software/re/redis/default.yaml` ✓
2. `/Users/al/Documents/GITHUB/saidata/software/te/terraform/default.yaml` ✓

Both files:
- Use schema version 0.3
- Have no checksum fields
- Have proper structure with sources, binaries, and providers
- Validate successfully

## Next Steps

The consolidation is complete. You can now:
1. Continue using saigen normally
2. Make changes to prompts in `saigen/llm/prompts.py`
3. Make changes to context building in `saigen/core/context_builder.py`
4. No need to worry about duplicate files or which version to edit
